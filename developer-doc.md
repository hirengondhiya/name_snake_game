# Purpose and Scope
## Application functionality
## Problem Statement
## Target Audience
## How to use the application
<!-- 
Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:
- describe at a high level what the application will do
- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
- identify the target audience
- explain how a member of the target audience will use it	
 -->
# Features
<!-- 
Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature


Ensure that your features include the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling


Note: If the features you described do not require you to use all of the above it is likely that your application is not sophisticated enough. Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient to address the criteria for T1A2-7.

## Should accept user name as input.
## Should use arrow keys to move snake in up,down,left and right direction.
## Should game over if snake cuts it self.
## Should produce apple which can be eaten by snake to grow.
## Should should accept difficulty level and automatically move snake in the direction last chosen by the user.
## Should track user score and display at end of the game.
## Should allow user to play again without ending the application.
## Should allow user to quit during the game play.
## Should produce with letters from user name and let user win when they build snake with their name.

# User Interaction and Experience
<!-- 
Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user
 -->

# Control Flow Diagram	
<!-- 
Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.
 -->

# Implementation Plan
<!-- 
Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item
 -->
