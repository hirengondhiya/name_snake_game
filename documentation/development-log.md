| 1.      | 2 Nov 2019 16:00  | Idea generation    | Discussed three ideas with Bianca about possible applications that can be delivered in given time. We discussed about QnA chat bot which depends on Microsoft provided QnA api generator. Since the api is not free to use after initial 3 days dropped the idea. Another two applications discussed with games snake and 2048. Agreed that I will do more feasibility study to see if I can quickly build any of this game as a terminal app.                         |
| 2.      | 7 Nov 2019 10:00  | Idea finalization  | Tried to figure out what are the technical challenges that I might face if I decide to implement Snake game. One of the challenge would be refreshing the screen when something moves on the game board. I figured out that it can be solved by continuously erasing and repainting the board. Another challenge was detecting keypress without user pressing enter every time during the gameplay. Found out that I can use STDIN library to overcome this challenge. |

The app is now ready to be submitted for evaluation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
