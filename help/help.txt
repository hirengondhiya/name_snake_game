The snake game is a game inspired from snake game found on classic Nokia phones.

The goal is to feed the apples produced by the game to the snake wihout hitting boundries of the wall and wihout running over it self. Each time the snake is fed with an apple it grows a bit.

The application recognizes two command-line parameters.
1. -username: 
    This optional parameter can be used to pass username to the game.
    Usage ruby index.rb -username="name of the user"
    Please note 
        Equal sign (=) after the parameter name must be used to assign the username value to the parameter
        If the name is more than one word it should be enclosed in quotes (")
2. -help: 
    This optional parameter can be used to show the help file it does not need to be passed any value to the parameter. If any value is passed to -help it would be ignored.
